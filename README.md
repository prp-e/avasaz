## Setting Up the model 

### Prerequisites

- At least 10GB of GPU VRAM (current model is very large. In the near future, the model can be ran on a smaller GPU as well.)
- Python 3.8 and above. 

### Inference 



Currently, Infrerence is only available on _Colab_. Codes will be here as soon as possible.
